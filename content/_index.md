title: Felix's blog

I'm an electrical engineering student at ETH Zurich. Currently I'm involved
with student rocketry as well as working on the occasional personal project. I
want this to be a hub for the random blurb and occasionally some more thought
out writings or [book reviews](/misc/book_reviews).\
Feel free to email me under:
