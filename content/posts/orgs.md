Working on mid to large scale projects either solo or with a tiny group of
friends has entirely different dynamics to the vast majority of work done
either at companies or at student organizations like FSAE or your local
rocketry team.

The largest difficuly within a student organization is creating an environment
that grows in parallel to the strongest team members without making it
impossible to onboard new personell. No system at the volunteer scale is so
complex that it cannot be grasped by a talented and experienced student within
a month or two. They must then be continuously challenged lest they grow bored
and move on, leaving behind work that while undoubtedly excellent is unlikely
to have been well integrated into the grander project scope.

In the following I attempt to provide a set of ground rules that attempt to
keep such organizations effective through harnessing the power of talented
individuals working in small groups while retaining the benefits of
organizations, primarily easier acess to funds and network effects. They are
partly my own and partly taken from sources of insipiration I've found
throughout my life.

## Set clear project milestones

Members at every level need to have a sense of responsibility for what they're
working on. Even if it's just a small piece of code, they should know it's
their job to keep that up to standard. Additionally there need to be some
consequences for non-compliance, even if it's just a stern talking to or some
well worded advice.

## No problem should have to be solved twice
reeuse existing work, communicate between projects, try to understand but
nonetheless question requirements and decisisions, especially those from senior
members or people who seem smarter than you.

## KISS
Especially people who'se brains are full of knowledge and information about the
issue at hand are prone to overengineering. If you don't act against this
constant drive for complexity, your project is as good as dead. Make sure that
you also have someone checking your work, lest it appear as gospel in the eyes
of your peers and remain unquestioned. Anyone who's written software will know
how much boilerplate can be in the first attempt at an implementation. Just
think if your codebase looks like the latest React GPT Slop and reconsider.

## Iterate
This one is likely to cause pushback for two reasons. First, iterating is
rather costly in material while only really saving in the long term. Since
you're always strapped for capital it's difficult to apply this everywhere, but
I would recommend you to try. Secondly the "move fast and break things"
attitude is often disliked due to it's apparent disregard of member safety.
Additionally build your systems in a way that they are independently testable.
## Introduce Economic measures
allocate scarce resources effectively. Use off the shelf solutions when
possible, build when necessary. Keep the greater scope of the project and
organization in mind.

## Eliminate politicking
With the introduction of roles and responsibilities there also comes the
endless bickering of people unhappy with their current place. This is natural
to a degree, but is kept to a minimum if there is transparency within the
project. Most people that volunteer for something have a rough idea of if they
deserve to be given more responsibility or not. Introduce some kind of
performance metric to promote members based on merit. As always, attitude is no
substitute for competence.
## Emphasize dynamic execution over excessive planning
don't hire people we don't need, build small teams and allow them to expand
naturally based on workload demands, rather than preemptively hiring
organizational roles.

## Make a lasting and sustainable impact

ensure that the work done not only adds immediate value but is also aligned
with the future goals of the organization. Build things that are maintainable
and well documented such that your successors can ensure that your work lives
on within theirs.
