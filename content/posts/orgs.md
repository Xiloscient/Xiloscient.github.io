Working on mid scale projects either solo or with a tiny group of friends has
entirely different dynamics to the vast majority of work done either at
companies or at student organizations like FSAE or your local rocketry team.

The largest difficuly within a student organization is creating an environment
that grows in parallel to the strongest team members without making it
impossible to onboard new personell. No system at the volunteer scale is so
complex that it cannot be grasped by a talented and experienced student within
a month or two. They must then be continuously challenged lest they grow bored and move on, leaving behind work that while undoubtedly excellent is unlikely to have been well integrated into the grander project scope

someone can within a few months grasp and understand the most complex parts of the system that person needs to be able t

0. **Set clear project milestones** with enforceable consequences for
   non-compliance.
1. **No problem should have to be solved twice**, reeuse existing work,
   communicate between projects, try to understand but nonetheless question
   requirements and decisisions, especially those from senior members or people
   who seem smarter than you.
2. **KISS: Keep it simple, stupid**, no part is the best part. A genius admires
   simplicity, an idiot admires complexity.
3. **Accelerate cycle time**, mandate the separation of components and
   prioritize comprehensive testing while iterating agressively. Move fast and
   break things.
4. **Automate**, humans are prone to error. Automation allows us to perform
   repetitve taks and test their exact output beforehand.
5. **Make a lasting and sustainable impact**, ensure that your contributions
   not only add immediate value but are also aligned with the future goals of
   the organization, through maintainable and well documented work.
6. **Introduce economic measures**, allocate scarce resources effectively. Use
   off the shelf solutions when possible, build when necessary. Keep the
   greater scope of the project and organization in mind.
7. **Emphasize dynamic execution over excessive planning**, adapt technology,
   workload and staffing to actual requirements.
8. **Don't hire people we don't need**, build small teams and allow them to
   expand naturally based on workload demands, rather than preemptively hiring
   organizational roles.
9. **Eliminate politicking** within the organization and introduce objective
   performance metrics to promote based on merit. Attitude is no substitute for
   competence.
10. **Establish a dedicated media team**, update sponsors, document progress
    and preserve milestones for future reflection, thereby enhancing the
    quality of our livestreams and public engagement.

These changes are crucial for fostering a more efficient, innovative, and
respectful workplace. I trust that the board will consider these
recommendations seriously, as my continued association with the organization
depends on the implementation of these improvements.
