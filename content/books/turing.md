Book runs you through most of early cs math, with a special focus on Russell’s
principles, as well as Gödel and Hilbert.  Turing’s work is discussed from a
solution to first-order predicate logic, less from an engineering viewpoint.

Excellent to review the fundamentals and to grasp the essence of the proofs
involved in the process. I especially enjoyed the section on the discussion of
the halting problem, as well as the uniting of λ-calculus with the turing
machine.

Not all is positive; sometimes the comments seem to add little value to the
descriptions as provided by Turing. A more modern approach could rehash this
with modern programming concepts, making it more relatable, but would lose much
of the appeal of following this through Turing’s lens.

All in all, recommended reading, but by no means necessary.
