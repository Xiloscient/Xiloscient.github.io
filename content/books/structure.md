This was truly an incredible read. Did not expect to enjoy a relatively old
book on the history of science as much as I did. It focuses on big innovators
(notably Newton, Lavoisier, Einstein and Maxwell) and uses their historic
positions to illustrate his points clearly. It's about as page-turny as such a
book can get.

It's influence, both wrt content and linguistically is immense. Just so that
terms like "paradigm shift" have taken on a life of their own and changed much
from their original meaning.

Much of what kuhn describes, students becoming scientists, has lost itself in
college politics and bureaucracy. The most innovative fields like CS ahve their
research done in large parts by private companies. Will be interesting to see
where the next paradigm shift brings us to.
