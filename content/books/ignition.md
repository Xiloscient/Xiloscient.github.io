> 8/10

While i came in with high expectations, they were not met. The book is
interesting, has plenty of characters, but doesn’t get much across. It’s far
more a collection of personal anecdotes than an analysis of propulsion tech.
Nonetheless, it has some value in the history department, and clark’s jovial
tone really helps here. Overall, it’s quite dated and i’d only refer it to a
well educated person with an eye for history.

overall 5/10
