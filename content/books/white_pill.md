This was not an easy book to get through. One is often bewildered by the extent
of the depravity of a system predicated upon evil. Such a system does not
propagate via evil men, but via cowards, second handers and those happy to
simply follow orders. But one notices that similarly, bravery can be extracted
from everyone. Collective action against totalitarianism has brought real
actionable results.

The world is built by those who improve it, Genius raises us further than evil
could hope to push us down. The threat of totalitarianism is omnipresent, but
the global maximum liberty. Itâ€™s the goal all society will eventually converge
to.

> It is possible that those of us who fight for the dignity of mankind will lose our fight. It is not possible that we must lose our fight. That is the white pill.
