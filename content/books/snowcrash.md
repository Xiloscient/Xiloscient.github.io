What a lovely ride this one. Enjoyful for the action and dystopia alonne, this
one also adds quite the deep subtext in philosophy, grammar, linguistics, all
of it. Frankly, i'm not even sure the story would be that terrible of a future;
Sure it's devoid of many of the amenities we have right now, but the neigh
anarchic structure does seem to work quite well.

The way the automation, say the librarion, work are quite interesting. They
speak, but don't think. Current LLM research tends to show how much of thought
directly transfers from speech: Metaphors, relationships, higher order
function. It's motivated me to look into religion more as well, we see if I get
to read some scripture in due time.
