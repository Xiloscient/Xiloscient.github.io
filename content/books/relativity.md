I feel as if my ability to absorb material at this density is reduced as my
sleeping schedule goes nightward. nonetheless, iâ€™ve picked up some invaluable
insights from this work, among others: the relation of E and B fields under
lorentz transform.  Utterly didactic and probably best as a companion to the
lecture series. highly recommended.
