In 2020 we wanted to perform some of the first amateur ISS films. For this we
built a few prototype telescopes, one of which I explain in an old video
[here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5csj0oxSfc). Ultimately we constructed
a mobile automatic telescope with a 16‚Äù mirror that featured an in-house serial
communication protocol as well as using computer vision models to track the
satelites without human interaction.
