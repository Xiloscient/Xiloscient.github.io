## Using HUGO to create a static website

After quite some thought I settled on using hugo to build this blog page.
It allows me to easily write $\LaTeX$ as well `code` since it renders it all in Markdown.
Since I already have a large amount of `.md` notes integration is seamless.
On top of that it integrates particularlt well with github-pages, which I am using to host this site.

$$1+1 \frac{1}{1}$$
