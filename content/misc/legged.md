# Proposal for legged rover design
I will focus mostly on absorbing the impact. For the legged robot the locomotion is probably the easiest anyway. Just use high quality tires and we *should* be good.

## Goals
- Resistance to harsh environment (Temperature, Collision, Drop)
- Easily deployable
- Movement indepedent of Ground profile (tunneling, rolling, etc)
- Collection of data
- Power management (solar, batteries)
