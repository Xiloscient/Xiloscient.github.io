## Review

Excellent book. It's not a particularly heavy read, nor is it a revolutionary
or mind-altering one but it is incredibly fun. The worldbuilding is some of the
best I've seen in a near future scenario and a true breath of fresh air from
all the apocalyptic decel writing that's rather prevalent nowatdays. Reminds me
a lot of Heinlein. Characters are realistic, with real strengths and weaknesses
That don't contradict each other. The Inner Psyche of Marcus, a kind of space
trucker, is explored thoroughly with the interplay between him and Miranda,
essentially the heiress of the unnamed founder of SpaceX beeing forced. The
physics and engineering are next level. It's actually consistent, fits into the
worldbuilding. The way tech is distributed makes a ton of sense and you're not
left wondering, as is the case so often, why someone doesn't just use this
abundant knowledge and development to get rid of scarcity.

**Final Verdict:** incredibly pleasantly surprised, can recommend.
