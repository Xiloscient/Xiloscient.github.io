## Review

Excellent book, it's not a particularly heavy read, nor is it a revolutionary
or mind-altering one but it is incredibly fun. The worldbuilding is some of the
best I've seen in a near future scenario and a true breath of fresh air from
all the apocalyptic stuff. Reminds me a lot of Heinlein. Characters are
realistic, with real strengths and weaknesses that don't contradict each other.
Inner Psyche of Marcus (the Main Character) is explored thoroughly with the
interplay between him and Miranda not beeing forced. The little romance there
is works well, the AI actually acts its age and isn't just omnipotent.

The physics and engineering are really next level. Like, incredibly so. It's
actually consistent, fits into the worldbuilding. The way tech is distributed
makes a ton of sense and you're not left wondering, as is the case so often,
why someone doesn't just use this abundant knowledge and development to get rid
of scarcity.

**Final Verdict:** incredibly pleasantly surprised, can recommend.
