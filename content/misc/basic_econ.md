Excellent and very concise. Especially for the uninitiated this provides
excellent ground work in economics. I Recommend to read some select chapters
that one finds interesting, that makes the most sense. Frankly, a few graphs
would've helped. The lack of equations make sense, though the amount of
percentages is basically the same thing as a graph and visualization would not
hurt.
