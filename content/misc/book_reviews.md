description: a few words on some of the books I've read

Occasionally I read a book or two and then decide to review it and post my thoughts here:

- [Neuromancer: William Gibson](/misc/neuromancer)
- [Basic Ecnomics: Thomas Sowell](/misc/basic_econ)
- [Elon Musk: Walter Isaacson](/misc/elon)
- [Theft of Fire: Devon Erikssen](/misc/theft)
