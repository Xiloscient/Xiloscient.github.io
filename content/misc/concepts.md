title: More Design Concepts
description: RSL pitch 2
---

Had some conversations with experienced ppl I know.

## Main Takeaway:
- Tensegrity not that great
- Ball design actually cool

## New Designs
### Thrusters
- Sandflea like design
- 4 Thrusters, one for each cardinal direction.
- Multiple drops possible through having many CO2 cartridges
- Needs *very* good solenoids to actually work
- Inflight stabilization through rotation wheel.

Frankly, I really like this concept. It's absurdly challenging and might not work, but is worth the attempt.
Due to the near total anullement of impact force we're capable of installing more sensors etc.
### Airbag
- Not the biggest fan and in my opinion just makes the project less interesting.
- Nonetheless, retractable and multi-use airbags would be a cool development

**Downside:** Turns the project into one large challenge, building the airbag, and the rest is straightforward. imo *too* straightforward.
