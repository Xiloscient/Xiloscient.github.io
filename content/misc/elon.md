Overall an excellent read. Isaacsons writing style is very distinct and
surprisingly near identical to his talking. Nonetheless a significantly more
thorough telling of Mr. Musk's life than the Ashlee Vance book. Particularly
enjoyed the focus on the more psychologiical side of his, offering a new
perspective on his life. Interesting to view as both an inspiration and a
cautionary tale. Overall, nothing massively new for me, whilst remaining quite
Interesting. At the same time, interesting to take with through life. Ways of
handling decision making and the need to step forward in times of crises. Also
pretty unbiased, possible to arrive at both extremely negative and positive
conclusions aboust Mr. Musk.
