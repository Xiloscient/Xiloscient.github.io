## Short Report
Overall an excellent read. Isaacsons writing style is very distinct and surprisingly near identical to his talking.
Nonetheless a significantly more thorough telling of Mr. Musk's life than the Ashlee Vance book. 
Particularly enjoyed the focus on the more psychologiical side of his, offering a new perspective on his life.
Interesting to view as both an inspiration and a cautionary tale. Overall, nothing massively new for me, whilst remaining quite Interesting.
At the same time, interesting to take with through life. Ways of handling decision making and the need to step forward in times of crises.
Also pretty unbiased, possible to arrive at both extremely negative and positive conclusions aboust Mr. Musk.
